## G'day! I'm Jason Hutchens from :australia:

I'm an engineer specialising in startups, web development, game design and AI.\
I :heart:â€‚Ruby, Vue and C, and have also worked professionally with JS, Python, C++ and ~~Java~~.\
I love Terry Pratchett and They Might Be Giants too :star_struck:\
I work on interesting things 100% remotely from Perth, Western Australia.
